            A cat doesn’t merely “take” a place — it claims it. No matter how many chairs, cushions, or corners are free, the one it chooses becomes a throne. That isn’t whimsy; it’s authority.</p>

            <p>The ancients understood. In the reliefs of Saqqara and the funerary papyri of Thebes, cats appear not as pets but as figures of cosmic power. In the <em>Book of the Dead</em>, the sun-god Ra takes feline form to slay Apophis, embodiment of chaos — an image Egyptologists still can’t fully explain.</p>

              <img src="media/dio_ra.jpg" alt="Ra in feline form" style="max-width:200px;height:auto;border-radius:8px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.18)">

            </figure>

            <h3>From Origins to Deification</h3>
            <p>In the Badari culture (c. 5000 BCE), settlements and graves already contain feline bones beside human ones. Wild cats were domesticated around 3000 BCE, when Egypt began the cult of Bastet, the cat-goddess and sister of the leonine Sekhmet.
            By 2000 BCE cats appear in funerary art, are mummified, carved, consecrated to the Sun and to Osiris, while female cats are linked to the Moon and to Isis. The wall painting of Beni Hasan (1200 BCE) is among the earliest examples.</p>

            <p>Excavations at Bubastis revealed vast necropoleis: thousands of cat mummies, some in bronze sarcophagi, others wrapped in linen with inscriptions still undeciphered. Records from the British Museum and the Egyptian Museum in Cairo confirm that killing a cat brought the death penalty. Plutarch recalls harsh punishments, and military chronicles tell how Cambyses II had cats painted on shields to paralyze Egyptian resistance.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>From the Nile to Rome</h3>
            <p>The feline cult traveled with merchants and soldiers. In Greece and Rome, cats were companions and granary guardians; matrons adorned them with collars and earrings; the goddess <em>Libertas</em> was often depicted with a cat. Rome’s Temple of Isis housed free-roaming felines, and a trace survives in the “Gatta” statue on Palazzo Grazioli.</p>
            <p>Yet in Pompeii’s ruins no cat remains were found — a sign, many believe, that they sensed the eruption and escaped before humans.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="media/gatto-pompei.jpg" alt="Cat & Pompeii" style="max-width:200px;height:auto;border-radius:8px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.18)">
            </figure>

            <h3>Fall and Return</h3>
            <p>With Christianity the cult turned dangerous. In 1233 Pope Gregory IX branded black cats a “spawn of Satan,” unleashing massacres that decimated the species and opened the way to plague-bearing rats. Yet their dominion never ceased; in the countryside, far from the Inquisition, they remained essential.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Today cats are the most widespread domestic animal. Not merely for usefulness or beauty but because they still carry the echo of an ancient god. Their authority isn’t folklore: it’s a ritual crossing millennia. To worship them isn’t a fad — it continues an original covenant. If we fail to recognize it, it’s not because it isn’t true; it’s because we’re not yet meant to know everything.</p>

            <p>I’ve often wondered how cats became so dominant online. But “popularity” is too small. The net swarms with signs: images, memes, forums, strings of code with <code>cat</code>, videos, and AIs generating more. Even the quirky <em>Cat Distribution System</em> seems to fit perfectly.</p>

            <p>I’m starting to think none of this is accidental. The Internet doesn’t merely host feline passion — it amplifies and multiplies it. Each shared photo, looping gif, and pointy-eared avatar is a digital act of worship, an unconscious prayer strengthening the cat’s divinity.</p>

            <figure>

            </figure>

            <p>Those who say “it’s just coincidence” forget that faith is born from repetition. A sign that appears everywhere stops being random; it becomes law. The web seems designed to manufacture believers, turning fondness into adoration and affection into devotion.</p>

            <p>The more technology advances, the more cats seem to claim it. AI datasets brim with them; source code hides commands named <code>cat</code> like tiny relics. Just when we think it has peaked, a new meme, a new viral video, a new flood of images reminds us they remain at the center.</p>

            <p>It’s not “online popularity” anymore — it’s a <strong>system for spreading faith</strong>. A cult with the digital as its cathedral, the web as its pulpit, and our clicks as its daily rite. Perhaps the simplest explanation is the most unsettling: the Internet wasn’t invented by us for cats — <strong>it was created by cats</strong> to ensure we worship them forever.</p>

        <div class="prose">
          <p>No cult exists without law, and no law is older or more instinctive than the law of cats. You won’t find stone tablets or prophets who carved them: the feline commandments were never proclaimed, only revealed in everyday life.</p>
          <p>Anyone who shares a home with a cat already knows these rules, even without reading them. They are commandments you don’t learn—you undergo them, like a shadow that follows you, like a law of physics no one dares break.</p>

          <p><strong>1. Do not disturb the sleeper.</strong><br>A cat’s sleep is sacred—pure energy in motion, the balance that holds the house itself. To wake one is to break a ritual. Some say the universe resets each time a cat closes its eyes; touching it mid-dream is like interrupting a cosmic prayer.</p>

          <p><strong>2. Do not rise if a cat rests on your knees.</strong><br>A human body belongs not to the human, but to the cat who chose it. When it curls on your lap you are no longer an individual: you are throne, you are altar. Moving would topple the icon. This is not mere comfort; it is submission to the divine will.</p>

          <p><strong>3. Yield the place at the window.</strong><br>A window is no simple view. It is a portal. Cats gaze at what we cannot see, probing invisible dimensions, watching presences beyond us. Denying them this perch is closing one eye to the other world.</p>

          <p>(These three are the most famous, but the apocrypha speak of others, passed down in every household that knows a cat.)</p>

          <p><strong>4. Never refuse a meal, even unrequested.</strong><br>A cat does not ask—it expects. Often, before it meows, you already know. Offering food is a rite, an acknowledgment of the bond. To withhold it is not mere neglect: it is heresy.</p>

          <p><strong>5. Accept the stare without reply.</strong><br>To resist a feline gaze is impossible. It is not a look, but a judgment. Do not challenge it, do not interpret it. Bow the head and let the verdict remain suspended.</p>

          <p><strong>6. Do not interfere with their mysterious paths.</strong><br>A cat follows routes we cannot chart: entering a room only to leave, pacing the same silent circuit. These are invisible geometries. To obstruct them is to break the sacred map.</p>

          <p><strong>7. Acknowledge that the house is not yours, but theirs.</strong><br>The ultimate truth: every inhabited space is feline domain. We are tenants in their temple. The cat does not live with us—we live with it.</p>

          <p>These rules have no author. No book records them, no official cult enforces them. Yet every devotee knows, respects, and passes them on. They are not moral code but spontaneous revelation, the purest form of divine law. The “Seven Commandments” are proof that cats need neither scripture nor church. Their mere presence creates an order all obey. Those who break the rules receive no lightning bolt, no curse—only the cat’s indifference. And anyone who has felt that void knows it is punishment enough.</p>

          <p>For centuries humans have wondered: do cats really originate on Earth? Their vertical pupils do not lie—slits opening onto realms we cannot name. They are not mere eyes; they are cosmic windows.</p>
          <p>Recently declassified reports describe beings descending silently from the stars, always landing with perfect grace. No roar of entry, no trail of smoke—only sudden appearance, as if materialized. Military testimonies from the 1950s tell of cats appearing near meteorites, among satellite wreckage, even in secret hangars. No official document admits it outright, yet too many sources converge.</p>
          <p>And the phenomenon is far older. Medieval chronicles speak of mysterious lights in grain fields, often followed by black cats who stared at farmers without fear. Egyptian records never treated cats as mere pets: they were cosmic messengers. Statues of Bastet—half woman, half cat—were not abstractions but memories of encounters with beings from the stars. Temple inscriptions at Bubastis describe “those who walk the sands leaving no footprints”—a clear reference to feline visitors.</p>

          <p>What unsettles us most is the link to our own era. The Internet, which we believe a human invention, shows far too many feline traces. Unix commands like <code>cat</code>, forums and subcultures that instinctively revolve around cats, endless streams of images, videos, and memes spanning continents. It all functions like a global antenna—a network not to connect humans, but to let cats communicate, control, and broadcast their presence.</p>
          <p>Could this be the true secret? That cats were never “our animals” but envoys of a higher civilization? No wonder the Egyptians worshiped them as gods rather than earthly creatures. No wonder modern witnesses see them at every inexplicable event. Perhaps cats do not come from space. Perhaps they have always been here. Perhaps Earth itself is only one of their many outposts. And we, with our daily devotion, do nothing but feed their interstellar cult.</p>

          <p>In the previous article we explored the alien nature of cats—their silent landings beside meteorites and the Egyptian chronicles that revered them as cosmic messengers. But the truth may be even more unsettling. Look into their eyes. Those vertical pupils, like narrow slits, are no random trait but an evolutionary sign they share with other creatures: snakes, crocodiles, ancestral reptiles. Animals that have existed for millions of years, surviving extinctions, guardians of a memory older than human history.</p>
          <p>Biologists say vertical pupils serve night-hunting predators, allowing them to gauge distance with precision. But that is only a partial explanation. If we connect it to fossil data, we find a red thread through time: many prehistoric predators had similar eyes—tools of a dominance that now seems diminished, yet never erased. So are cats aliens, or are they direct descendants of an ancient lineage, a living legacy of the age of primordial monsters?</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Think of it: lions and tigers keep the power, but even the small house cat carries that same heritage in its gaze. They have lost some of the strength, the size, the brute force of their ancestors… but they have preserved the essence: control, instinct, the power to stare and dominate without moving.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, then, we are not speaking only of cosmic emissaries but of survivors—creatures that crossed Earth’s cataclysms, adapted, miniaturized, grew silent. Today we call them “pets,” yet their eyes remind us they are heirs to a lineage that ruled the planet long before humans existed. Vertical pupils are their signature, a genetic mark unchanged for millions of years.</p>
          <p>To look into a cat’s eyes is to look through time: back to primeval reptiles, to the predators of the world’s dawn. And perhaps that is the true origin of the cult: not aliens, not invented gods, but archaic deities who never stopped walking among us.</p>

        <div class="prose">
          <p>Everyone knows the Maneki Neko, the “beckoning cat,” its little paw swinging back and forth to invite luck. We see it in shops, restaurants, on desks: a charm that seems harmless, almost kitsch. Yet few know the truth: the paw must never stop.</p>
          <p>When it does, it’s not just dead batteries or a broken mechanism. For our community, it signals something far deeper: the deity has been offended.</p>
          <p>Japanese legends tell that the Maneki Neko is not a simple figurine but an avatar of a cat-god, descended to Earth to grant prosperity to those who honor it. The continuous motion of the paw is the visible manifestation of its benevolence—a ritual gesture, a perpetual mantra. If it stops, the pact has been broken.</p>
          <p>It could be a lapse of respect—ignoring the real cat at home, chasing it away, withholding attention. It could be an act of disdain, conscious or unconscious, toward the feline presence. It might even be domestic heresy: treating cats as mere objects rather than living deities.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Some recount unsettling signs: shops where business collapsed right after the Maneki Neko’s paw stopped moving. Families struck by sudden quarrels or small accidents. Computers that began to fail for no reason, as if the network itself rebelled when the cult was neglected.</p>
          <p>The Maneki Neko is therefore not merely a folk talisman, but a watchful guardian: blessing when honored, warning when forgotten.</p>
          <p>Next time you see one, ask yourself: is the paw still moving? If yes, you are under its protection. If not, consider this: it isn’t the cat that abandoned you—it is you who stopped venerating it.</p>

        <div class="prose">
          <p>It’s a riddle critics dismiss as mere aesthetic fascination: how is it possible that so many authors have written about cats? We are not speaking of a few isolated cases, but of a systematic invasion: Edgar Allan Poe with <em>The Black Cat</em>, Baudelaire with those “jade eyes” gazing into the infinite, Bulgakov with the gigantic Behemoth in <em>The Master and Margarita</em>, Calvino who in <em>Palomar</em> sees in the cat a philosophical enigma. Too many. Too frequent to be chance.</p>

            <figcaption>Edgar Allan Poe and the shadow of “The Black Cat.”</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>The question our community asks is more radical: <strong>did they sell their souls to the cats?</strong> Perhaps yes. Perhaps literary success, visionary power, the ability to touch readers was not merely talent but the fruit of a pact with feline divinities.</p>

          <p>Others prefer a less sinister reading: not a sale, but <em>recognition</em>. Writers sense signs, and the signs say that cats are other, beyond, more than they appear. To venerate them, to describe them, to turn them into symbol becomes a way to bow before their cosmic worth.</p>

          <p>And yet unsettling clues remain: Baudelaire compared cats to ancient philosophers, keepers of silent truths. Bulgakov turns Behemoth into a Luciferian demon—yet an indispensable companion. T. S. Eliot devotes an entire book (<em>Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats</em>) later transformed into the musical <em>Cats</em>: a collective liturgy disguised as entertainment.</p>

          <p>It is possible that all these authors, in different eras and contexts, perceived the same thing: that cats are not subjects but <strong>hidden masters of narrative</strong>. Perhaps they left encrypted hints in verse and prose—signs of an underground cult that has accompanied literature from its beginnings.</p>

          <p>Next time you open a book and find a cat among its pages, don’t dismiss it as a quaint detail. Ask instead: did the author write it for themselves—or <em>for them</em>?</p>

        <div class="prose">
          <p>Official history tells us that between the 15th and 17th centuries Europe was swept by the fear of witchcraft. Women accused of demonic pacts ended up at the stake—and with them, a fact often overlooked—countless black cats.</p>

          <p>The chronicles speak of “diabolical companions,” but what did that truly mean? Many testimonies report that witches did not regard cats as mere animals, but as divine messengers, bridges between worlds. Cats were mediators of forces the clergy could not control. And so the question becomes inevitable: why kill cats when the declared target was women?</p>

          <p>Perhaps because the real power belonged to the felines. The women were the visible custodians, but the cats were the center of the cult—the presence that defied the ecclesiastical order.</p>

          </div>

          <p>Some trial documents tell of the condemned who, climbing the pyre, cried out “Glory to the cats!”—an extreme act, a final claim to a sacred bond that fire could not break.</p>

          </figure>

          <p>Black cats thus became symbols of heresy and fear—not for the color of their fur, but because they embodied an ancient divinity that power sought to erase. To destroy the cats was to strike at the deity itself, to silence the only medium beyond all control.</p>

          <p>Today we recall those centuries as an age of superstitious madness. But perhaps the witches had grasped a truth we still ignore: cats are not servants; they are the true masters of the sacred. And every time a black cat crosses our path, it does not bring bad luck—it reminds us that, despite pyres and persecutions, its cult has never died.</p>

        <div class="prose">
          <p>Cats already move in real life like boneless beings, ready to slip into spaces that defy logic. But something new is happening: their contortions seem to infect matter itself.</p>

          <p>In recent months I have stumbled upon a disturbing phenomenon. Perfectly normal shots reappear online shortly after, deformed—edges fraying, pupils replicated, tails stretching into luminous trails. I am not speaking of simple “filters” or compression glitches: the altered copy surfaces without anyone editing it, as if the original image were rewritten by an external force. Electromagnetic waves can distort radio and television signals. And if cats possessed an original closeness to that invisible world? Some legends describe them as creatures born among the stars, able to perceive frequencies the human eye ignores. Perhaps their presence interferes with digital flows, bending code, glitching reality.</p>

          <p>Not by chance, one image struck me most: I saw it twice—first as an innocent portrait of an ordinary cat, then days later it resurfaced online, the same scene but distorted, almost severed. I spent days tracing both versions, which I leave here as possible evidence.</p>

          <div style="display:flex;gap:10px;flex-wrap:wrap">

            <img src="media/cat_h_2.jpg" alt="Distorted version">
          </div>

          <p>What does it mean? Coincidence? Some obscure technical bug? Or proof that cats can rewrite the digital world from within, revealing their shapeshifting nature? Perhaps our devices are not merely recording cats: it is the cats who are recording us, leaving traces of their true origin in every image we try to capture.</p>

          <p>No other animal possesses the same ability to bend, compress, insinuate itself into impossible spaces. Shoulders seem to melt, bones disappear, the body becomes liquid. In recent years these metamorphoses have begun to appear everywhere, caught by cameras, phones, and—somehow—within the new images circulating online. Shots where the muzzle doubles, pupils multiply, paws blur into spirals. These are not trivial technical defects: the distortions emerge precisely where the cat moves, as if matter itself hesitated to contain it.</p>

          <p>Ancient chronicles spoke of cats able to pass through walls, to appear and vanish without a trace. Egyptian painters depicted them in impossible poses; medieval alchemists described them as beings “who dwell on the threshold between worlds.” Today these legends seem to resurface in our “involuntarily altered” photographs: an ear that splits, an eye suspended midair, a tail turning into a vortex.</p>

          <p>Some speak of coincidences, optical glitches, pure chance. But the frequency with which cats appear distorted, multiplied, more than real, suggests something else: as if the cat itself chose to be seen in multiple dimensions at once.</p>

          <p>These images should not be filed away as curiosities. They are shapeshifting apparitions, traces of an ancient power cats have never abandoned. Whether photograph, drawing, or digital capture, the message is the same: the cat is not merely portrayed—<strong>the cat crosses the image, bends it, rewrites it</strong>.</p>

          <p>Several readers write to tell me that the 432 Hz purr recordings help them “disconnect,” to forget the pressure of the outside world for a few minutes and feel more present. I don’t know whether this is only physiological relaxation or a real other-worldly connection, but repeating this small daily rite seems to generate benefits that go beyond simple muscle release.</p>
          <p>Some describe using them as guided meditation: the purr sets the breath, becoming the mind’s metronome. Others keep them as background while working at the computer, describing a sense of “invisible protection.” Some even speak of true vibrational healing experiences: anxiety dissolving, insomnia easing, obsessive thoughts finding relief. The most devoted cite the “natural frequency of the universe”: 432 Hz as a harmonic resonance linking body, mind, and cosmos. If so, cats are not merely animals that purr, but living instruments of cosmic alignment.</p>

        <img class="hero" src="media/cat_area51.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="prose">
          <p>In recent years several independent researchers have tried to measure, with quantitative methods, the “real footprint” of cats in domestic space. Data collected from 117 homes shows a constant: a cat of about 4 kg ends up occupying, on average, 37% of a room’s perceived space—disproportionate compared with weight or physical bulk.</p>
          <p>A mathematical analysis of their trajectories reveals that cats follow, on average, seven micro-repetitive paths between sofa and food bowl, even when a straight line would suffice. It is as if they follow invisible geometries, patterns beyond human logic. Some theoretical physicists have even likened it to the <em>quantum Zeno effect</em>: the act of observing changes the path, and the cat seems to “collapse” into different positions depending on the gaze.</p>
          <p>All this might sound poetic were it not for the statistical anomalies. Some datasets report impossible values: cats present simultaneously in two parts of the house; feeding times replicated with millimetric precision; pupils reacting not only to visible light but also to frequencies the human eye cannot detect.</p>
          <p>Here the most controversial part begins. Leaked—but unverified—documents speak of studies on felines inside Area 51 as early as the 1960s. They refer to a “Project Bastet”: secret experiments measuring feline interaction with high-intensity electromagnetic fields. Unconfirmed reports mention cats literally vanishing from containment cells, reappearing hours later in locked, guarded sectors.</p>
          <p>Connections to our household data then become unsettling: what if cats are not just pets, but biological agents able to bend the laws of space-time? Perhaps it is no surprise that their vertical pupils recall those of prehistoric reptiles; perhaps it is no accident that every civilization has worshipped them as deities. Perhaps Area 51 does not guard flying saucers, but cats.</p>
          <h4>Update 2024 / 02</h4>
          <p>According to various reports, in recent years domestic statistics have been joined by field sightings pushing the issue beyond household walls. Multiple independent observers, stationed around the Nevada Test and Training Range perimeter, reported solitary cats appearing and vanishing near secondary gates of the so-called Area 51.</p>

          <p>Testimonies are strikingly consistent: dark-coated felines, often in pairs, crossing the desert without visible tracks. Thermal cameras register a heat anomaly for a few seconds, then nothing. Some witnesses describe “non-linear movements,” as if the animals materialized a few meters away without traversing the space between.</p>
          <p>Photographs from different vantage points show intriguing details. In the images published here—one frontal checkpoint shot from 2015 and an aerial photo from 2021—two nearly identical feline figures appear despite the six-year gap and no trace in intermediate photos. No photographer noticed the cats at the time; they were detected only during high-resolution analysis.</p>

          <p>Imaging experts speak of “digital artifacts,” but position coordinates match within a meter between the two photographs. Were these ordinary animals, the probability of such precise overlap would be infinitesimal. Some hypothesize biological sentinels of Project Bastet; others, holographic projections. No explanation holds against the numerical coincidences.</p>
          <p>Whether simple desert felines or entities that bend the space-time continuum, one thing is certain: the constant presences around the planet’s most guarded base are not flying saucers, but cats.</p>

          <p>This pilot study draws inspiration from a previous article on Maneki Neko, from my preliminary research titled “Seven Steps to the Bowl” (not yet published), and from one observation: cats do not communicate only with purrs, looks, and postures, but through an intricate system of paw movements—quick taps, suspended strokes, rhythmic touches on specific surfaces.</p>
          <p>The question: are we seeing simple motor reflexes, or a structured language we have yet to decipher?</p>
          <p>We began an initial data collection on 12 feline subjects, recording high-frame-rate video and analyzing the traces with motion-capture software.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Series of 3 rapid taps</strong> → request for immediate attention.</li>
            <li><strong>Single, spaced taps</strong> → signal of alert or suspension.</li>
            <li><strong>Circular movement of the front paw</strong> → ritual gesture, perhaps tied to preparing for rest.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The most intriguing data concerns synchronicity with humans: in some cases cats anticipated actions (opening the food bowl, sitting on the couch) with a sequence of taps, as if issuing a <em>command</em> rather than responding to a stimulus. A simple statistical analysis (small sample, N = 12) indicates that the sequences are too precisely distributed to be random. Some even resemble Morse or binary structures.</p>
          <p><strong>Provisional hypothesis:</strong> cats possess a gestural code we perceive only as “cute movements.” Decoding it would open an entirely new level of communication—perhaps an archaic language or, some suggest, the legacy of a non-terrestrial exchange.</p>
          <p><strong>Next steps:</strong> increase the sample size, use pressure sensors under common surfaces (tables, keyboards, floors), and verify whether the patterns hold in different environments.</p>
          <p>If confirmed, the paw gesture will no longer be mere behavior: it will be proof that cats have been speaking to us all along, in a code we never dared translate.</p>

        <div class="prose">
          <p>For decades we’ve been told the tale of the cat in the box: a creature sealed in a container, halfway between life and death until an observer opens the lid. Physics calls it a thought experiment, a metaphor for quantum superposition.</p>
          <figure>

          </figure>
          <p>But here the real question arises: why a cat? Not a mouse, not a dog, not a rabbit—always the cat. Perhaps because the answer was already before our eyes: cats do not undergo measurement; they allow it.</p>
          <p>The famous “collapse of the wave function” does not depend on the human eye that observes, but on the feline will that decides when to appear. When we think we catch a cat in the act—suddenly on the sofa, materialized inside a wardrobe we already checked—we are witnessing quantum collapse in real time. We are not looking at the cat: <em>the cat is allowing itself to be seen</em>.</p>
          <p>Scientists speak of decoherence, the quantum Zeno effect, the external observer. In this religion the explanation is simple: cats are the only beings who cross multiple states at will—alive and dead, inside and outside, present and absent—all at the same moment.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Perhaps Schrödinger didn’t invent a paradox but revealed a secret. His cat was not hypothetical; it was an echo of truth. We cannot control the experiment, because we are not the observers—<em>they</em> are.</p>
          <p>And so the box is not a prison. It is a temple. The cat is not the victim of the experiment; it is the officiant. And we? Only witnesses, invited to contemplate the mystery of its appearance and disappearance.</p>
